- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fcall-dev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in frontend development, with strong trends towards mobile development, but, as a code lover, you can expect me to code in any languages or frameworks. To give you an idea, my first adventures in the world of programming were in PHP.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently mostly focused on expanding my knowledge in Kotlin and Swift. I'm diving into the universe of native mobile development, seeking to expand my reach in the development of hybrid applications (Flutter/React Native).
- ðŸ“« You can always reach me at my email: fabiocalliari@hotmail.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / him / his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a degree in chemical engineering (and I already caused a small explosion in the chemistry laboratory at the university where I studied).
